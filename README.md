# A Coin Counter

This web page will allow a user to calculate the smallest amount of coins needed to get the total amount. There are four editable coins and an input field for the total value. The user will fill in the coin values as well as the total value field and press calculate to get the smallest amount of coins needed. 

For example, if the total is 18 cents and there are 25, 10, 5, and 1 coins. Then the application should return one 10 coin, one 5 coin, and three 1 coins.
